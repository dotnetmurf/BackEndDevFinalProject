            <h1>TechHive Solutions User Management API (Minimal)</h1>
            <p>
                This project is a User Management API built with ASP.NET Core Minimal API for TechHive Solutions. It
                enables TechHive's HR and IT departments to create, update, retrieve, and delete user records
                efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
                This API was developed as a three-part final project for the <a
                    href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/back-end-development-with-dotnet?specialization=microsoft-full-stack-developer"
                    target="_blank">"Back-End Development with .NET"</a>
                course with a focus on leveraging Microsoft Copilot for code generation, enhancement, and debugging. The
                project requirements can be viewed <a href="docs/project-requirements.txt" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The GitHub repository for this project can be found <a
                    href="https://github.com/dotnetmurf/BackEndDevFinalProject" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding how Copilot was used in this project's development process, transcriptions of the prompts
                that were used and the conversations that occurred were captured and saved in text files. These files
                can be found in the <a
                    href="https://github.com/dotnetmurf/BackEndDevFinalProject/tree/master/wwwroot/docs"
                    target="_blank">/wwwroot/docs</a> folder in the project's Github repository.

            <h3>Alternative Implementation</h3>
            <p>
                An alternative implementation to this API was developed using a Controller API approach. This version 
                was developed to explore the differences between Minimal APIs and Controller-based APIs in ASP.NET Core.
                The GitHub repository for the Controller API version can be found <a
                    href="https://github.com/dotnetmurf/TechHiveAPI" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>CRUD operations for user management</li>
                <li>In-memory user store with test users</li>
                <li>Input validation and robust error handling</li>
                <li>Custom middleware: error handling, authentication, logging</li>
                <li>Swagger/OpenAPI documentation</li>
                <li>JWT Bearer token authentication</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Testing with Swagger UI</h2>
            <p>
                To test the API endpoints, you can use the Swagger UI interface that is automatically generated for the
                API. However, an authorization token will be required to access the endpoints. To send the authorization
                token in Swagger UI, follow these steps:
            <ol>
                <li>Click <a href="swagger" target="_blank">here</a> to open Swagger UI in a new page (usually at
                    /swagger or /swagger/index.html).</li>
                <li>Click the "Authorize" button (often a lock icon at the top right).</li>
                <li>In the value field, enter: <strong>your-secret-token</strong></li>
                <li>Click "Authorize" and then "Close".</li>
            </ol>
            Now, all your API requests from Swagger UI will include the authorization header with your token.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other tools like Postman can also be used to test the API endpoints by including the authorization token
                in the headers. Please see the <strong><em>Testing</em></strong> section in the README.md file for more
                details.
            </p>
            <h2>Resetting the List of Users (user store)</h2>
            <p>
                The API exposes an POST endpoint (/users/reset) to reset the user store to its initial state. You can
                use the Swagger UI
                interface that is automatically generated for the API to call this endpoint if a reset of the user store
                is needed.
